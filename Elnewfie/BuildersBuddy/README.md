Folder Structure
================
Builders' Buddy is maintained as an Eclipse project, using the [LSLForge](https://lslforge.googlecode.com "LSLForge") plugin.  These files are stored in the
[source](source "Source") directory.

For people just looking to copy the scripts and use them, look in the [releases](releases "Releases") folder.  These versions are far prettier and will
compile as-is in the Second Life script editor.

Builders' Buddy
===============

License
-------
Builders' Buddy is Copyright "Newfie Pendragon", avatar name of the person in Second Life.

Builders' Buddy is available under two potential licenses.  For most folks, the Attribution-Only license will suffice.  For those with specific needs, a
commercial license if available.

Why two separate licenses?
--------------------------
Simple: Builders' Buddy is a complex set of tools, and it takes many hours to create and maintain.  The creator of Builders' Buddy requests merely a statement
of acknowledgement in order to use his work as part of the "free" license.  There are however individuals that wish to use Builders' Buddy without such
acknowledgement; in those cases a monetary reward shall appease his sense of ego.

How do I select which license to use?
-------------------------------------
For most folks, just use License #1 ("Free" Version) and comply with the terms.  For a commercial license, please contact Newfie Pendragon, either via Second Life
private message, or via the GitHub repository.

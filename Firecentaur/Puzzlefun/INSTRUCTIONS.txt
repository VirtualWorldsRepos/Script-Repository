PUZZLE FUN INTRODUCTION
=====================================Hi everyone, Fire Centaur here,

This is a great multi-player game for your events in Second Life.

You can load your own (copy/mod) Textures into Puzzle Fun, or use the pre-loaded holiday puzzles!

This puzzle game is great for educators or anyone who wants to have a fun in Second Life.

Just in time for Christmas, this Puzzle game comes with a Christmas textures loaded in its inventory.  

To play the game, the owner just needs to click the game board, and select a puzzle! 
The Puzzle will then rezz 25 puzzle pieces.  When finished rezzing, a count down timer begins and the pieces will scatter themselves within 10 meters of the puzzle.  

Visitors then just click the puzzle pieces and then the board to place a puzzle piece.  The puzzle piece will zoom into place.  
If correct, the piece will lock into position, otherwise it will bounce out!

I've designed this game to be a collaborative or single user activity. Its super easy to use and fun!
NEW - It now comes complete with special sound effects for extra fun!
The owner can also press a "Show Names" Button to display who correctly placed each piece on the puzzle.  This is great for interactive scoring!

Happy Holidays!
